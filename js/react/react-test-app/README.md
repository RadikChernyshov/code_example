#### Test task

##### Create Web Application using React as a frontend framework

We’d like you to build a simple react app which displays a list of people from the Star Wars API - https://swapi.co/documentation.

The Application should:
    
     - Render a number of people into a table – as many as you like
     - The table should be sortable (ascending or descending) by some dimension of the data (date, name, whatever you like)
     - You should be able to click on a person and see more details
     - You should be able to save people to a ‘favourites’ list
